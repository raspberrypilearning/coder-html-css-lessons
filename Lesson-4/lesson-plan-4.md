## Lesson 4 - Adding Some Style

###Introduction

CSS, also known as *Cascading Style Sheets*, is used to style and control the layout of webpages. In this lesson, students will learn what CSS is, what it can be used for and how to write CSS for the first time to apply fonts to their webpage.

### Learning Objectives

- Know what CSS is and how it is used in web design
- Understand how CSS can be used to style a webpage
- Be able to create custom styles for different elements of text on a webpage and apply them


### Learning Outcomes

**All students are able to:**

- know what CSS is and how it affects from HTML
- access the CSS panel on their webpages with Google Coder
- change the font used for `<h1>`

**Most students are able to:**

- change the fonts for all the types of text they have used on their webpage such as `<h1> <h2> <p>`
- add a size and weight to fonts with CSS

**Some students are able to:**

- apply advanced CSS to make the fonts look more interesting


### Lesson Summary

- HTML card sort activity
- A teacher led introduction to CSS
- A demonstration of how to access the CSS panel on Google Coder
- A demonstration on how to change fonts and sizes.
- Improved webpages with CSS


### Starter

Create student groups of 2 or 3 and give each group a set of [HTML cards](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/raw/master/Lesson-4/html-cards.pdf). Students are to match the HTML tag with the correct answer card. After a few minutes select each group to feed back one card to the rest of the class. 


### Main Development

1. Remind the class how to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers ensuring that students are allocated the correct SD card that they used in the previous lesson. Ensure they they can all log in. Students can use the [Student Instructions](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-4/student-instructions-4.md) as a guide to remind them of the steps.

2. Demonstrate how to access the CSS panel on a webpage project in Google Coder. Ask students to change the padding to show how CSS affects the webpage they have already created.

3. Next demonstrate how to change the font family, weight and size for `<h1>`. 
	
	*Note: It may be helpful to have a list of installed fonts avaliable for students to see displayed on the board.*

4. Allow students time to change the fonts for all their text types following the [student instructions](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/coder-html-css-lessons/blob/master/Lesson-4/student-instructions-4.md) 

5. More advanced use of CSS to make the text look more interesting could be an exstension task, for example making some of the heading text look blurry.

### Plenary

If students have a blog or eportfolio they should write about what they did in the lesson ensuring that they answer the following questions:

- What did you learn in this lesson?
- Did you encounter any difficulties, and if so what were they?
- Set two targets for improvement of your webpage for next lesson, e.g Adding colour to headings
