# Lesson 6 - Feedback & Evaluation

##Introduction

In this lesson, students will reflect on their webpage design and that of their peers for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability. This is an important part of creating any digital artefact in computing and it can be overlooked. 

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what makes a good webpage design
- Be able to apply feedback from others to their webpage design in order to improve it
- Evaluate a webpage design with given criteria

## Learning Outcomes

###All students are able to:

- Explain their likes and dislikes about a webpage design
- Set some criteria to be used by others to evaluate their webpage

###Most students are able to:

- Provide relevant feedback to their peers on webpage design


###Some students are able to:

- Explain the good and bad points about their webpage design, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability


## Lesson Summary
- Class discussion on reviewing website design
- Setup of Raspberry Pi Google Coder webservers
- Peer assessment against criteria
- Self-evaluation against criteria
- Improving webpages based on feedback and evaluation


## Starter

For homework in the previous lesson, students were asked to review a website of their choice by answering the following questions:

- What is the name of the website?
- Who is the target audience?
- Do you think it is well designed or badly designed, and why?
- Are the colours easy on the eye? 
- Is the layout clear and uncluttered?

Select students to feedback their reviews to the rest of the class. Draw out from these reviews evaluation criteria that students identified as being important, and display them on the board. Discuss what makes a good webpage design.

## Main Development

1. Ask students to connect their Raspberry Pi equipment together and boot their Google Coder servers, then log in and open their webpages that they have been working on. 

2. Next ask students to swap seats with a partner. Using the critera generated at the start of the lesson, students should review their partner's webpage, giving relevant helpful suggestions for improvement. Afterwards, students should return to their seats, read the feedback carefully and make one of the suggested improvements to their webpage. A note of the improvement could be made on the student's blog or e-portfolio if they have one.

3. Using the same criteria, students should then self-evaluate their webpage and make any impovements that they see fit. A note of the improvements could be added to a blog or e-portfolio to record the changes.

## Plenary

Select students to explain the journey their website design took during this lesson: 
	- What did the webpage look like at the start of the lesson? 
	- What improvements were suggested by others? 
	- What changed as a result of the feedback?
	- If they were to start the project again, what would they do differently?

If students have access to a blog or e-portfolio they could answer these questions in writing, completing them for homework.
